# 16-Project-2-Professional-Materials

In this homework I updated my portfolio page. I updated the contact section with the Github, LinkedIn, email and phone number link. I also updated the navigation link and added the resume to the navigation. When you click on resume a resume pdf will open in another tab. I also updated the about section with more information and updated the project section with the first project I worked on and two homework assignments. 

- Created using HTML and CSS. 

- Use Flexbox to help structure the layout of the site.
